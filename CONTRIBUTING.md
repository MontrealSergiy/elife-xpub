## Introduction

This file outlines common default principles to govern how the team will use GitHub to organise its own workflow. This is to ensure that:

Current team members are clear on one common workflow.

We are able to easily on-board new starters with these introductory principles to team-working.

Stakeholders are able to easily track progression of the project.

## Our Principles

* We will prioritise reviewing Pull Requests (PRs) over beginning new issues.
* Where possible, issues will include a user story and product requirements/acceptance criteria as well as links to relevant designs.
* Where possible, issues will be grouped together according to the product feature they relate to.
* After two days' effort, an assignee will add a comment to an issue and/or consider raising new issues to clearly indicate progress.
* When feedback is required, an assignee will open a PR with the 'WIP' prefix. See [this ADR](https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-xpub/blob/develop/docs/adr/0001-pull-request-workflow.md).
* As we facilitate deployment on a per-branch basis, once a PR is merged it is considered 'Done'.
* If a feature can reasonably be tested using an existing end-to-end test, this will be undertaken before the PR is approved. Any further or additional end-to-end testing will be raised in a new issue with the 'e2e test' label and referencing the original issue.
* An issue will never be re-opened, unless closed in error.
